            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1 Of one inherently juſt: here Iuſtification is made, either by pleading the act committed, no fault; or if a fault, not committed. This is to bee juſtified by a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1876:12"/> righteouſnes of ones own, by declaring the party cleare, the accuſation falſe. It is of uſe, and onely in the Court of man: <hi>Ierem,</hi> 26.15, 16.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of ſuch as are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herently juſt: here Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is by confeſſing the fault done, and by pleading ſatisfaction. For ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Non-commiſſion, are alike equall in Iuſtice. Now ſatisfaction may bee made legally in a mans owne perſon, or Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, by another, a Surety. Theſe things in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall premiſed, we proceed to the other particulars to be explicated, where wee ſhall apply what hath been laid.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:1876:12"/>
            <p>The ſecond is the Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of falſe cauſes; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A man is not juſtified by the works of the Law. The whole law is here meant, therefore the morall too. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> have an untoward conceit of a double merit, whereby they would bring in works. Take what they ſay, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and briefly: There is a <hi>Merit of congruence:</hi> It is the doing of that worke which is good in it ſelfe, and though it deſervedly merit not, yet being good, there is a congruence or fitneſſe that God ſhould reward it, hee being alſo good, and a lover of good, where he ſees it: So that if a man, meerely naturall, do ſay a Maſſe, give an Almes,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1876:13"/> or the like, there is a fitnes, or congruence to reward. There is a merit alſo of <hi>condignity,</hi> which is a juſt deſerving upon the former merit. A man by doing a good worke, deſerves by Congruence, though he be yet natural, that God ſhold give him grace; and having grace, now hee juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, becauſe <hi>Gratia gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum facit,</hi> and being graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in Gods eye, God muſt needs reward him. This is all, and all is nothing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming under this ſtrict ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, with the workes of the Law. But they have one refuge ſomwhat more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till.</p>
            <p>They ſay, the workes of the Law, which are exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1876:13"/> from Iuſtification, are the works of <hi>Free-will,</hi> ſuch as goe before faith: but ſuch as follow after faith, are not excluded. They would ſeeme to draw this gloſſe from the words of the Text, reading them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the vulgar La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Tranſlation, <hi>Non ex ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus, niſi per fidem; Not of the workes of the Law, unleſſe by faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus they argue, Indeed works are excluded, unleſſe they be done by faith; but from faith, they receive a Iuſtifying power: and thus they bring in workes to ſhare in the buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>But to this we anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the works of the Law, and the workes of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1876:14"/> Faith, are not ſet in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, but the workes of the Law, and Faith. For they would have a falſe ſuppoſition granted, that though Works of Law are excluded, yet Workes of Faith are not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That ſuch workes as are done in Faith, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily excluded. Look onely upon <hi>Abraham,</hi> a faithfull man, the <hi>father of the faithfull,</hi> his workes were many, they were glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, nor can wee deny them to proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith, yet the Apoſtle fully e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough proves it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. that hee had not in his workes, <hi>whereof to glory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</hi>

Whereas we know, (to give you the thing cleare by this ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude) that although the eye alone ſee, yet if it were by it ſelfe alone, it could not ſee at all. There is no part of my body can ſee an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect viſible and preſented, not my eye-lid, not my fore-head, not my braine, but my eye onely: yet if my eye were taken out of my head, I could diſcerne nothing.

            <p>This for the ſecond, The excluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of falſe cauſes; the third thing propounded for explication, is, The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignement of the true me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious cauſe of our Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification: The Text de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares it to be <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> His merits,<note place="margin">Hic vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur eſſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicatio ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minorum.

Take it in a briefe head, thus; Where there cannot be Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by plea, it muſt bee by ſome other propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable means, which we call, Satisfaction. This Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction muſt be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the offence; this being infinite, that muſt be alike infinite. Man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1876:17"/> cannot ſatisfie, for both his doings, and his ſufferings, are limited. It muſt be done by another; now all creatures are both unholy, and finite; and the two requiſits neceſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Let nature ſearch this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, ſhe wil eaſily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded; nay, let the ſoule
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1876:18"/> that ſinned, bee put upon the ſearch, it leaves ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and fals to deſpairing. Briefly, it muſt fal, upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the appointment of an higher wiſdome, namely, Chriſt, in whom thoſe fitneſſes do all meet. Therefore, the Righteouſneſſe of the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, is that which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally is in Chriſt only. See how the Apoſtle inlarges and explaines himſelfe in this, in his holy zeale, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt proud Zelots: they being ignorant of Gods righteouſneſſe, and going about to eſtabliſh their owne righteouſneſſe, have not ſubmitted themſelves to the righteouſneſſe of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>

            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:1876:22"/>
            <p>But to cleare our ſelves of this, we argue againſt it briefly, thus:</p>
            <p n="1">1. No man is Iuſtified by an act of his owne; This propoſition is true from expreſſe Scripture, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.5. <hi>By grace ye are ſaved; ver.</hi> 9. <hi>Not of workes:</hi> Now the chayne is ſurely linckt, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and ſalvation; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 29, 30. Or more in the words, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.6, 7. Not by works of righteouſneſſe which wee have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us, being Iuſtified by his grace. <hi>And if by grace, then it is no more of workes, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe grace is no more grace, Rom.</hi> 11.6. But to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, is an act of our own; I meane not any excluſion
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1876:23"/> of the ſpirits helpe, for God workes all our works in us; onely this I would ſay, that the work takes its denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from the next a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and man is ſaid to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve: Therfore it is cleare, no Iuſtification by the Act of beleeving.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God accounts that for perfect righteouſneſſe, which is ſo indeed: The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle witneſſeth the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Gods truth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Wee are ſure that the Iudgement of God is according to truth.</hi> But they dare not but confeſſe it, that Faith is not indeed true righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Law: or, if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, yet this were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough againſt it, that if Faith were that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1876:23"/> and Iuſtification were by it, then a man ſhould be Iuſtified by two righteouſneſſes, which no reaſon wil admit; for if one be ſufficient, there needeth not any other; and to grant it, what were it but to thruſt out Chriſt and all his merits, as if he were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and they inſufficient.</p>
            <p>They reply ſomewhat, and ſtrangely, in an odde diſtinction of a double Iudgement in God: <hi>Iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Iuſtitiae, et Iudicium mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſericordiae:</hi> They ſay, God ſometimes iudgeth with a Iudgement of Iuſtice, and then hee accounts nothing for ſuch, but what is truly ſuch: Sometimes with a Iudgement of mercy, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1876:24"/> then laying aſide rigour, he graciouſly allowes, what in truth is not ſuch.</p>
            <p>But what impiety is this, indiſtinguiſhing of God, to ſeparate God from God, his Truth from his mercy; Nay, they doe ever meete in God. In another kinde, we wil admit the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not divide: God lookes upon the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, here is a Iudgement of Truth; God lookes upon that righteouſneſſe as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us, not otherwiſe ours, here is a Iudgement of mercy; the double Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they ſpeake of, yet <hi>Mercy and Truth are met together.</hi>

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1876:26"/> to patronize ſinne, by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us from that Law, by vertue of which, ſin is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated. If we, who, that we might bee Iuſtified, have given our names to Chriſt, doe yet want righteouſnes, unleſſe wee embrace Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, and the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Law, then we ſhall bee enforced to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that Chriſt is a Miniſter of ſinne. A Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of ſin is hee which tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth us what to doe for Righteouſneſſe, and ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies and ſhuts us under ſinne; thus, in ſtead of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, Chriſt ſhould bee a tyrant, a deſtroyer. But this were falſe, and abominable to conceive, therefore the Apoſtle addes his <hi>Abſit,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1876:27"/> God forbid. Moſes</hi> onely was a Miniſter of ſinne, Chriſt is a giver of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and the Scriptures are wont to promiſe it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the benefit of him, <hi>The Redeemer ſhall come out of Zion.</hi>

I have puld downe that frame and ſtructure of the Law, that it may not reigne in the Conſciences of Chriſtians; if I return to the Law which I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly forſaken, I ſhall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt my ſelfe to bee a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceizer,

The Argument is continued in the 19. <hi>verſe;</hi> no recourſe is to bee had unto the Law againe, for by the Law, <hi>I

               <hi>that I might live unto God;</hi> So that now the Law hath no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over us, which he ſpeaks directly againſt them, who ſay, <hi>Wee muſt live unto the Law, if we meane to live unto God.</hi> Nay, wee are dead to the commands of the Law, not onely free, but dead; ſo though the Law live ſtill, it hath nothing to do with us; a ſlave once dead, is no longer ſubiect to the hard uſages of his tyrannous Maſter, though he call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and urge him, he heares not, obeyes not, becauſe he is dead. So are we to the Law, in this buſineſſe of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification. Here is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a law, and a law; ſome underſtand both to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1876:28"/> ſignifie the ſame: By the ſentence of the Law it ſelfe I am dead unto the Law: it ſelfe tels us, that it is not perpetuall, but Chriſt is the End of it, when Chriſt comes, it ceaſeth to rule.

               <p>There is a various Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: 1. A liberty in cauſes and effects, that mutable order between an Agent &amp; an Effect, both voluntary. That the Agent may either worke, or not worke ſuch an Effect. This is oppos'd to Neceſſity. 2. A liberty in the Will, a naturall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the reaſonable creature, to chuſe or refuſe an object of its owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per motion.<note place="margin">Libertas in genere, eſt ſtatus ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum quem quis eſt ſui Juris et alteri no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> obligatus.

                  </note> Thus the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable is left to his owne Election. This is oppoſed to Coaction. 3. That Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which is the right of a creature, either Perſon, or Thing, to worke of its

The two former are not here meant, onely this third, which is oppoſed to ſervitude, is proper to this place: yet not in al reſpects; for againe, this Liberty is twofold; Civill, and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall: The latter is that which concernes our Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, &amp; concerning which, I would propoſe to ſpeake of.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It is an Immunity; therefore it ſuppoſeth wee were once bound. The words in our Common-Law, which gives light un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this peece of Divinity, Immunity, Freedom, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe, Enfranchiſement, do all ſignifie an exemption from ſomewhat wee were under before.

               <p n="1">1. From the Coaction of the Law: for the Law doth burden a man, and hinder the alacrity of his obedience. A precept of the Law is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy mind, with all thy ſtrength.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To bee empty of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loves, to ſet the ſole
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1876:34"/> affection upon God. Here the moſt perfect faile, for though our love unto God be ſincere, yet we are, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, drawne off with other luſts. But the Law tels us, <hi>He is curſed that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues not in all.</hi> Now we ſee what ever we endevor, we are ſtill under the Curſe; our workes are, <hi>Mala quia imperfecta,</hi> therefore evill, becauſe not perfectly good. This dulleth the heart, and diſcourageth it from any offer. The peeviſh eye of a froward Maſter, makes the ſervant heartleſſe. What ſhould I do any thing, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whatſoever I doe, I cannot pleaſe. This is the burden of the Legally righteous: the taske it ſet,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1876:35"/> they muſt either doe it, or ſmart for neglect. The <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> are beaten i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. Wee are freed from Indifferents, when they prove burdens.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Things. The Iewes were bound to uſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1876:35"/> many things, the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and Refuſing of which had elſe beene Indifferent. They muſt abſtaine from Swine, from things ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and the like. We have liberty of a freer uſe of Gods creatures; being not ſubject to ordinances; <hi>Touch not, Taſte not, Handle not, Col.</hi> 2.20.21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Men. We are not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to ſuch commands, as whereby they would bind the conſcience. Now the conſtitutions of men are either,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Civill and politicall; Theſe wee have a rule for, that wee muſt obey them, though in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.23. hee ſeeme to give exemption; <hi>Yee are bought with a price, be

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Eccleſiaſticall; Theſe concerne either,</p>
               <p n="1">1 The matter of Gods worſhip; then we renounce them as great preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for Divine worſhip cannot have inſtitution from humane command.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Or the manner of worſhip, tending to decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: Here Conſtitutions may order, not bind; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1876:36"/> the carriage, not binde the conſcience.</p>
               <p>But concerning both theſe and thoſe Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I meane, both Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall and Civill, I would deliver my ſelfe a little more fully; and to that end, wil preſent a few concluſions touching In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differents, their nature and extent.</p>
               <p n="1">1. An Adiaphoron or Indifferent, is, <hi>Res media,</hi> a middle thing, which ſtands ſo to two extremes, that it may alike incline to both. And in the ordinary, though not proper uſe of the word,<note place="margin">Medium Abnegatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis. Medium Participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis. Aquin.</note> it is a <hi>Medium</hi> betweene morall good and evill. Now ſuch a <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> is either of meere Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negation,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1876:37"/> ſo all Subſtances, whether naturall or artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, are <hi>Res mediae,</hi> Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things; or of ſome participation, which ſo farre agrees with either extreme, as the extremes agree between themſelves; ſo no Subſtances are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Indifferents, but A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions only: Actions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which are neither commanded nor forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and which in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſicke nature, have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obedience, nor diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, are indifferent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Indifferent Actions in their owne intrinſicall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nothing differ among themſelves, but are all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually far from good and evill: But there are ſome
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1876:37"/> which, for the moſt part, have evill circumſtances accompanying them, and therfore ſound in the worſe ſenſe, as if they did incline to evill; as to be an accuſer may be indifferently good or bad, yet we ill interpret that name. On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſome Actions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly accompanied with good circumſtances, as to be ſtudious, ſound wel, and are conceived to tend to good, though a mans ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy may as well be evill and corrupt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Indifferents ceaſe to be Indifferents, when by Authority, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded or forbidden. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ought to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, but onely good;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1876:38"/> nor any thing but evil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited. What is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the nature, cannot ſimply, abſolutely, and perpetually be forbidden, or commanded; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded as it comes nearer to good; and as nearer to evill, forbidden.</p>
               <p>From theſe grounds wee may draw Rules, for our freedome from, or obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to, for changed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differences, and the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wee have the nature of our freedome deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; now the Ends both of it, and of the doctrine of it, are;</p>
               <p n="1">1. To pacifie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that that great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector, may not be left flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1876:38"/> but may know what ground it hath, and how it may proceed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To remove away ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, that the minde may know, it is not tyed to a throng of needleſſe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, and diſcouraging feares.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To direct us in our worke, in the comfort and readineſſe of our ſet wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There remaines the third propoſed, The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents from the former.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The freedome is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall; therefore,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Not Civill: Then are the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> mad, who would reject all law, and make the whole world le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell; denying obedience
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1876:39"/> to Lawes and lawfull Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates; a diſeaſe begun in the diſtempered heads of <hi>Iohn of Leiden,</hi> and the mad men of <hi>Munſter;</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed among others chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the holy zeale of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> whoſe doctrine of Reformation was dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly miſtaken by thoſe fanatickes: which I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. Not Carnall whence then are our ordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes in the uſe of good things; our ſurfetting ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and variety of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates

But theſe are Indifferents: True, if they bee uſed indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, but Exceſſes are not. What may bee law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſed, by an inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate deſire to it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it, is made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane. Such Inordinates are defiled, and by the witneſſe of the Apoſtle, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.15. <hi>To them that are defiled nothing is pure.</hi> Our Saviour hath ſhewed a difference, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.2. <hi>Woe unto you that are rich, for yee have received your Conſolation: Woe unto you
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1876:40"/> that are full.</hi> 'Tis lawfull to enioy an eſtate; Why then is the Woe againſt them?

               </p>
               <p>When wee come to be at eaſe in our enioyments, we abuſe our Liberty. But theſe things are then tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Indifferent, when wee are come to <hi>Pauls</hi> Reſolve, <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.11, 12. <hi>I have learned to be content, I know
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1876:40"/> how to bee abaſed, and how to abound, to be full, and to be hungry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Though Spirituall, it is an immunity. Then if wee have a Charter from heaven, how dare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deny it, or with-hold it. Thoſe miſerable men that are under the Popiſh yoake, have many heavy loads laid on their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; the Pontificials dealing with the Abuſed, as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Taskemaſters with the afflicted <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> they load them hard, and then beat them, when they are loaden.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ends are:</p>

They had ſo underſtood the Goſpell, that they had ſeene him, as it were, ſpit upon, ſcourged, reviled, crucified, and yet had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the faith in him. I cannot leave this, (though I intended but a ſhort Comment) without touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at two or three obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations very briefly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſer.</hi> 1. By faith belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Goſpell taught, they ſaw Chriſt before their eyes.</p>
               <p>Faith ſees things that are farre removed, and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1876:52"/> makes them ours; <hi>The evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of things not ſeene.</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons eye is farre more dull than this: This ſees truth in a promiſe for after times and beholds it with ſuch a ſtedfaſtneſſe, as if it were already preſent. Becauſe God hath promiſed it ſhall be, my faith ſees it already here. Let me inſtance one more particular; In the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, an unworthy <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant diſcernes not the Lords body;</hi> Naturall men ſee but a covered table, ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſignes, Bread and Wine, poore alas, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious Elements; But Faith beholds much under thoſe vailes, it ſees Chriſt, his body and bloud, it taſts
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:1876:53"/> and feedes upon Chriſt in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and attracts nouriſhment from what it feeds upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 2. When <hi>Paul</hi> taught the Goſpell, Chriſt was drawne forth before their eyes. It was <hi>Paul,</hi> whole worke but to paint out Chriſt. Himſelfe had determined to <hi>know nothing but Ieſus Chriſt, and him cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified:</hi> And hee will teach; but what he might ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know; <hi>And my ſpeech, and my preaching was not with inticing words of mans wiſedome,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.24. Our preaching muſt be plaine and lively: plaine, that Chriſt may bee truely painted before us: lively, that in the freſh knowledge
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1876:53"/> of his death, hee may bee crucified among us. They are bad Preachers that paint themſelves in their owne colours, inſtead of Chriſt. While in our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Sermons, we doe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily tell you, how many Fathers wee have read, how much we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the School-men, what Criticall Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſts we are, or the like: 'Tis a wretched oſtentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; we doe over much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect our owne picture, and paint unto you our owne Schollerſhip. It is not fit, that Divinity ſhould bee ſordidly attended, but with ſuch words as may both take the ſenſe and the underſtanding. Yet there
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1876:54"/> is moſt wiſedome and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy in Gods Oratory, the ſacred Scrrpture-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; and wee preach with moſt authority, when we deny our ſelves.

So our Saviour taught, it was the will of the Father which hee pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and hath received that praiſe by the <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt,</hi> from the Spirit of God, <hi>He taught as one having Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and not as the Scribes, Mat.</hi> 7.29.</p>

Let that be hung every where: I meane, not a wooden, or braſen, or though of ſome purer met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, gold or ſilver; but the ſaving knowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of Chriſt in the heart. Let him bee before your thoughts, as if your eyes ſaw him ſtretched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, and nailed to the Croſſe, his head bending in a ſolemne and yeelding poſture, his armes ſpread, as if wooing our embraces.

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1876:55"/> Image, but to make uſe of more profitable Preaching. Images were not brought into the Church, till prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching grew ſlacke. I need not inſtance you the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of <hi>Eliberis,</hi>

The Law could not make voyd the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; for, 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, The Covenant was before confirmed. 2. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>; in Chriſt, the Mediatour of the Covenant. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Law, and the Goſpell, doe much differ.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1876:70"/> The promiſes of the Law are to particular perſons, thoſe of the Goſpell to us in Chriſt. It comforts us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly in our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; we neither expect nor receive the promiſes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from God, but from Chriſts hand.

God gave the Promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> though the Law were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward given, it could not make the gift voide. If a rich man adopt another freely, and after ſome yeers lay ſome commands upon him, yet it hinders not, that the Adoption is free; for the Inheritance is not becauſe of thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>

               <p>There needes no more for the Argument; onely the Text of it doth occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a double queſtion; one Hyſtoricall, another Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologicall.</p>
               <p>The Hyſtoricall Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is, what Ratification the Apoſtle ſpeaks of? We read of three Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: 1. One by a faederall Sacrifice, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.18. when upon Gods command, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> had offered, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided his Sacrifice, in that ſame day the Lord made a Covenant with <hi>Abraham.</hi> 2. Another, by a generall expreſſion, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 17.1, 2. when <hi>Abraham</hi> was ninety yeares old and nine, the Lord appeared and ſaid, <hi>I am God All ſufficient, walke
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:1876:71"/> before mee, and bee upright.</hi> 3. A third by a ſolemne oath, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.16. <hi>By my ſelfe have I ſworne, ſaith the Lord, In bleſsing I will bleſſe thee.</hi> Here the firſt of theſe is ſignified: For, 1.

                  </gap>,] They that interpret Chriſt to be the Mediator, are diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for a fit ſenſe. Some give this; If Chriſt bee a Mediator, he cannot bee of one, but muſt needs bee of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:1876:87"/> two at leaſt; but God is one, but one; Therefore he muſt bee Mediator, as of God, ſo of men alſo. But what is this, either to the place, or the mind of <hi>Paul?</hi> Others pleaſe themſelves in this; A Mediator is not of one, but of two at the leaſt, if then Chriſt bee a Mediator, as indeed he is, It is of God and men, yet ſo, that Chriſt the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor being true God, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes not that there are two Gods, of which, one gives ſatisfaction to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; But Chriſt is one and the ſame God, with the Father and the holy Spirit. But for what reaſon ſhould they imagine the Apoſtle here to inſert the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:1876:87"/> doctrine of the Trinity. That of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi>

A Mediator is betweene two, or more parties that are at diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: Now the Cauſe of a Difference, is ſome tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion done either by both againſt each other, or onely by one of the parties againſt the other. Now
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:1876:88"/> the tranſgreſſion or offence cannot be in God, for God is one, hee is alwayes the ſame, ever iuſt.</p>
               <p>Thus it appeares how this belongs to the former Argument, <hi>The Law was added for tranſgreſsions.</hi> The people were at oddes with God, <hi>Moſes</hi> is the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, or Miniſter of that Law, which ſhewes tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and makes the people to Iuſtifie God, and condemne themſelves as tranſgreſſours againſt him.</p>
               <p>Before I leave this, let mee make a double appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from the main thing intended in the Obiection and the Anſwer, namely, the Obſervation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the uſe of the Law,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:1876:88"/> 
                  <hi>Ie was added for Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Of the continuance of that uſe, <hi>Added till the Seed came.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Concerning the uſe of the Law: The ſame phraſe noteth it to be,
<list>
                     <item>1. Civill.</item>
                     <item>2. Spirituall.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Civill uſe is for Tranſgreſſions, to reſtraine ſinne: yet by this we may preſſe the Apoſtolike Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, <hi>That Righteouſnes cannot be by the Law;</hi> for when the Law reſtraines us from being ſinfull, it doth not therefore make us not ſinfull, or truly righteous; but rather ſheweth us to bee unrighteous, and for that cauſe wee need a Law
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:1876:89"/> of reſtraint. A man that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaines from murder or theft, for feare of the halter or the racke, is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leſſe murderous or theeviſh in his diſpoſition, but Cares not venture upon the ſtrictneſſe of the Law. A Beare is a ravenous and devouring creature; when it is tyed in a Chain, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not devoure; Is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not a Beare, or leſſe ravenous, becauſe tyed; nay, the chaine rather ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues it to be cruell. So, we we ſee fierce Maſtiffs muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and tyed up, not that they are gentle, but the chaine is an argument of their fierceneſſe. If man had not beene ſinfull, there had not needed a Law.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1876:89"/> Now reſtraint by the Law, is not righteouſneſſe, but a proofe of our unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſhewes that wee would be evill, if we either could or durſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Spirituall uſe, is for tranſgreſſions, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe ſinne to our ſight; to diſcover unto us, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, and of miſery conſequent. The Law, as another ſtrong <hi>Hercules,</hi> ſets upon, and ſubdues the <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> of the preſumption of our owne Righteouſneſſe. It is an ordinary and moſt dangerous diſeaſe, to bee ſtrong in the opinion of our owne Something. Men that are not notoriouſly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, thinke themſelves ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Such was the <hi>Phariſies</hi>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:1876:90"/> vaunt, <hi>I thanke God I am not as other men, nor as this Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican;</hi> becauſe hee was no extortioner, no drunkard, hee thought himſelfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly what hee ſhould bee. The Law is to remove us from ſuch boaſtings, to melt our ſwellings, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy our ſtrengths. <hi>Is not my word like a fire,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>and like an hammer that breaketh the Roches in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? Ier.</hi> 23.29. Our hearts are thoſe Rockes, we ſtand high, and exalted againſt God, till the hammer bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter us, and bring us into ſhivers. Wee are proud in our ſtandings, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law is in its right place, when it ſpeaks Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and Terror, and ſaith
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:1876:90"/> to the amazement of the conſcience, See what thou haſt done, and what thou art like to ſuffer. Wee may conſider this ſomwhat bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the obſervation and application of that ſtory, of the manner how the Law was given. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were an holy people, they had, according to the precept, ſanctified themſelves, waſhed their cloathes, abſtained from their wives. Their fault was, they were but too ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they had it too much in their thoughts &amp; tongues, <hi>We are an holy people, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They muſt bee driven from this, if ever they bee fit for an humble ſervice.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:1876:91"/> The Law muſt bee given with terror, that when they ſhould ſee and heare and conceive nothing but hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, fire, and ſmoake, and clouds, and thunders, and earthquakes; ratling and confuſed noyſes, flames darkely, yet dreadfully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing through pillers of ſmoake, they might, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightedly, runne from the foot of the mountaine. The Text tels us, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.18. <hi>And all the people ſaw the thundrings, &amp; the lightnings, and the noyſe of the Trumpet, and the Mountaine ſmoking, and when the people ſaw it, they removed, and ſtood a far off; and they ſaid unto Moſes, Speake thou with us.</hi> Now they ſee their cleanſing
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:1876:91"/> and their holineſſe to bee nothing worth: Before, they were holy, very holy; now they finde, they were not able to abide in his preſence. Ah Lord, how wonderfull art thou, and fearefull in thy ſpeakings! O royall law, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Law-giver! There was a Light upon <hi>Sinai,</hi> but it was onely ſuch a flame, whereby they might ſee themſelves to be miſerable. The <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Goſpell</hi> are both Lights; the Light in the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> is to ſhew us <hi>Chriſt;</hi> 'tis as the ſtarre which led the Sages unto <hi>Bethlem,</hi> and ſhewes us the place where the Babe lyes, but the Light in the <hi>Law</hi> is not without ſmoake, or as
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:1876:92"/> Lightning from a cracke of Thunder, &amp; to that end, that wee may diſcerne our ſelves wretched. The <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Goſpell</hi> are both voyces; the voyce of the <hi>Goſpell</hi> is a <hi>ſtill ſmall voyce,</hi> it cheares up in ſpeaking; the voyce of the Law, is <hi>a wind, and earthquake, and thunder,</hi> 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 19.11, 12. And both the fire, and the noyſe, is, that we might be humbled, for then wee are fitted for mercy. <hi>The whole need not the Phyſitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but they that are ſick; Chriſt came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Ah, wee are too ſound, we are too holy; wonder not at ſuch expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions:
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:1876:92"/> Wee are too holy, and while wee are thus righteous, Chriſt doth not call us. Hee comes to <hi>ſave ſinners,</hi> that is his worke; till wee bee ſinners, Chriſt cannot come unto his worke: If ever we would have mercy, let us ſee that we need it. If we dare chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge mercy, we know we ſhall bee repulſed. Come humbly unto God in the acknowledgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of wants and doubt not of ſupply. If a Beggar tel me, though hee crave a penny, yet hee hath mony enough in his purſe, meat enough in his bagge, and friends that wil provide for him, he moves me to no compaſſion; but if his diſtreſſes cry, and he
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:1876:93"/> pleades himſelfe money<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and breadleſſe, and friendleſſe, and altogether helpleſſe, I cannot tell how to deny him. God would have us ſuch ſupplicants; wee are ſtrengthleſſe, and meritleſſe, and altogether worthleſſe; <hi>Mercy, Mercy, onely.</hi> This the <hi>Law</hi> drives us to, and then wee are fit for a Bounty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is the <hi>Lawes</hi> uſe, now let us ſee the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of that uſe: <hi>It was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded till the Seed ſhould come.</hi> As the phraſe is in another caſe; <hi>If the dayes of the Law had not beene ſhortned, no man could have beene ſaved:</hi> But the tyranny is now limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and wee, by Chriſt, may cry <hi>Victory, Liberty.</hi>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:1876:93"/> We may underſtand it;</p>

               <p>To Reconcile theſe, and to find out the Truth, wee muſt conclude, that both are true, though in divers reſpects; which wee ſhall diſcerne by obſerving theſe three particulars:
<list>
                     <item>1. To whom the Law was given, and to whom not.</item>
                     <item>2. The Cauſes, why the Law ſhould be abrogate.</item>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. To whom the Law was given: The Law, as gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Iewes,</hi>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:1876:112"/> it pertained not to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles:</hi> and thus it cannot rightly be ſaid to be abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated unto them, for none can be freed from the Law, but they that were under the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.5. The <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> were no more under <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, as being the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> than the <hi>Romans</hi> under the lawes of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> or <hi>Solon,</hi> the law-givers of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> and <hi>Athens.</hi> The <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſinned not againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:1876:113"/> the Law, doe by nature the things contained in the law; Theſe having not the law are a law unto themſelves, Rom.</hi> 2.14. Concerning the <hi>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of the firſt poſition. The latter ſort, though they were not freed by Chriſt, becauſe not in Chriſt; yet now they are <hi>nec Moſaici, nec Chriſtiani,</hi> properly, neither Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:1876:113"/> nor Moſaickes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt, howſoever, is the end of the Law; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are without ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony and without law, as being but uſurpers upon that which they ſtill hold and uſe. To Beleevers it was not given, as from <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and therefore none of them are obnoxious to it, as his: for though they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the ſame commands that <hi>Moſes</hi> gave, yet they are not ſubjects to it, but as now theirs by Chriſt. <hi>A New Commandement I give unto you, That ye love one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, Iohn</hi> 13.34. 'Tts a Commandment, for Chriſt is a Saviour and a Lord; 'Tis a New one, for wee have it from the hand of
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:1876:114"/> our Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Cauſes why law ſhould be abrogated. Theſe were,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Gentiles</hi> might be called; <hi>Now in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, ye who ſometimes were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farre off, are made migh by the bloud of Chriſt; for hee is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken downe the middle wall of partition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.13, 14 Whatſoever was <hi>Intergeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus paries,</hi> A middle wall of partition betweene <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> is broken downe and abrogated. But the ſubſtance of the Law did not hinder their conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation; <hi>for theſe did by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the things contained in the Law,</hi> Rom. 2.14. The
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:1876:114"/> Curſe was that among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things which divided, and equally divided them both from Chriſt; now that they might bee ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to, and meete in one Chriſt, the Curſe muſt be abrogated.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond cauſe was, becauſe it was an intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble burthen; as <hi>Peter</hi> tells them in the Councell, it was ſuch a burthen as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they, nor their <hi>Fathers were able to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re, Act.</hi> 15.10. Hee ſpeakes of the whole law, all the kinds; and the Apoſtle applyes it, <hi>I teſtifie againe to every man that is circumciſed, that he is a debtor to doe the whole Law, Gal.</hi> 5.3. That which makes the Law heavy, &amp; proves it to
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:1876:115"/> be a burthen, is abrogated; and therefore Chriſt calls us to another burthen, an eaſie one; <hi>Take my Yoake up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, for my yoake is eaſie, and my burthen light, Mat.</hi> 11.29 30. <hi>This is the love of God, that wee keepe his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements are not grievous,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third Cauſe was, becauſe the Law was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable; <hi>There is, verily, a diſanulling of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement going before, for the weakeneſſe and unprofitablenes thereof; for the law made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did, by the which we draw nigh unto God, Heb.</hi> 7.18, 19. In the firſt Tabernacle, were offered
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:1876:115"/> gifts and Sacrifices, that could not make him that did the ſervice perfect, as pertaining to the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.9. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> more particularly of the morall, <hi>What the law could not doe, in that it was weake through the fleſh, Rom.</hi> 8.3. The law being unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto Iuſtification, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the buſineſſe of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification it is abrogated.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A fourth cauſe, was, becauſe the law was perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; though not of its owne nature, yet through the fleſh, <hi>The Miniſter of ſinne, working wrath; But where the Spirit is, there is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi> And therefore the law, as a coacter,<note place="margin">Aug. <hi>3.</hi> Tom lib. de Spir. et Lit.</note> is abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:1876:116"/>3. I have paſſed theſe two more briefly, yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of them, to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; the third will chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge a longer ſtay, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, what things are ſig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nified under the word <hi>Law,</hi> and to apply what wee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for; the difference of the abrogation. It ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies;</p>
               <p n="1">1. The whole Scripture; <hi>The bleſſed mans delight is in the Law of the Lord, and in that Law hee doth exerciſe himſelfe, Pſal.</hi> 1.2, The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple underſtood it in this ſenſe, when they anſwered, <hi>We have heard out of the Law, that Chriſt abideth for ever, Ioh.</hi> 12.34. So the Law is not abrogate, not one Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of it failes.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:1876:116"/>2. The Bookes of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; All things muſt be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led which were written of me, in the Law of Moſes, and in the Prophets, &amp; in the Pſalms, Luk.</hi> 24.44. Neither thus is the Law abrogate, for the Doctrine and writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> remaine.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The paedagogy of <hi>Moſes</hi> in his foure laſt bookes; <hi>Had ye beleeved Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, yee would have beleeved me, Ioh</hi> 5.46. So 'tis, not wholly, not ſimply ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate. There are in it, Promiſes, Types, and Commands.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Promiſes and Types doe ceaſe, becauſe the things typified are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, the things promiſed are received: The houſe is
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:1876:117"/> built, and now no more need of the Idea or exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Commands, which were all thoſe things, whatſoever were delivered, <hi>in nomine Dei,</hi> in Gods name to the people; Theſe are not ſimply abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, ſome are eternall; all are called Law. Of which, <list>
                     <item>1. In generall.</item>
                     <item>2. More ſpecially.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In the generall, wee may take our deſcription of Law;</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the end. It is an ordination of right reaſon to the common and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar good of all and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſubordinates, given by him who hath the care of the whole Community,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:1876:117"/> and every ſingular in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the forme. It is an Ordinance commanding what is to be done, and to be omitted, made by him that hath right to require obedience, binding the apt creature to obey, with an holy promiſe of reward, and a threatning of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Both of theſe are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Divine, from God; or Humane, from man; as collected from Gods Law. Here we ſpeake of Divine; which may be conſidered;</p>
               <p n="1">1. As impreſſed on mens mindes by an innate ſpeech.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As enuntiated by ſpeech declarative.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As comprehended in writing. Here, of the laſt:
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:1876:118"/> And this in generall.</p>
               <p n="2">2. More ſpecially; the Law written, is called <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Law,</hi> which is threefold, as is the variety of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, Ceremoniall, Iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. The two latter are as Acceſſories to the firſt, the Ceremonies being added to the firſt, and the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the ſecond Table. The Ceremoniall, as alſo the Iudiciall Law, hath two parts; one externall, the other internall, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and the ſoule, or the ſubſtance &amp; the accidents, or the ſhell and the kernel. The inward thing of the Ceremoniall, is Faith and Piety; of the Iudiciall, is mutuall love and piety;
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:1876:118"/> theſe are eternall. The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thing of both, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abrogate; yet not all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually. Some Ceremonies are ſo abrogated, that they cannot be revoked againe without denying Chriſt. Some, and ſome politicke Lawes may bee received. But wee ſhall beſt diſcerne by handling all ſeverally.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Ceremoniall law is an ordinance containing precepts concerning ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall worſhip given to the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Church, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was yet an infant. The uſe of it, was,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To keepe the people under hope.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As a midwall to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate them from the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:1876:119"/>3 That by the obſerving of this, they might be kept from the Idolatry of their neighbours. This Law is abrogate by Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and by theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees;</p>
               <p n="1">1. In truth, in regard of neceſſity of the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In fact, by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Apoſtles, and by the deſtruction, both of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> the City, and of the Temple, the more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall place aſſigned for the worſhip.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Iudiciall Law is an Ordinance containing precepts concerning the form of government. Some of the precepts being of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, ſome of particular
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:1876:119"/> Right. The uſe of it, was,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there might bee to all a certain rule of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like equity: That in this ſenſe, <hi>Hieruſalem might bee as a City well built, compact together, Pſal.</hi> 122 3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That by their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward policy, they might be differenced from other Nations.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the government of Chriſt might be typified unto them. Concerning the Abrogation;</p>
               <p n="1">1. So farre as this Law is typicall, ſo farre it cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe Iudgements, ſimply, are neither forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, nor preſcribed unto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Such things as are of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:1876:120"/> common &amp; generall right, are ſtill in force, and muſt be obeyed, for what is in ſubſtance morall, is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall; wee may know the common, naturall, morall, perpetuall Iudgements, by two rules:</p>
               <p n="1">1. If they directly fence and give the guard unto a morall command; ſuch are thoſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.6. <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.12. <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.18.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If they follow from the light of Nature, and common right; as that, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.5. and others of like nature.</p>
               <p n="3">3: The Morall Law is ſcattered throughout the whole Bible, and ſumm'd up in the Decalogue. 'Tis an Ordinance comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:1876:120"/> thoſe things, which ſimply, God accepts, and will have done, of all men, at all times, every where; and forbidding the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. This is that conſtant and immutable rule, which is the image of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine will, by which the creatures live; and the ſumme of which is the love of God, and the love of our neighbours. To en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the abrogation of this, we will ſee, <list>
                     <item>1. The Subſtance of it.</item>
                     <item>2. The Circumſtances of it.</item>
                     <item>3. The Vſes of it.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Subſtance of the morall, is Love; which our Savior divides, <hi>To God,</hi> that is the firſt and great

The Apoſtle gives it in another method and diviſion, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.12. <hi>A godly, a righteous, and a ſober life.</hi> Thus the law is not abrogated, for the Subſtance is eternall.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Circumſtances were many;</p>

               <p>Theſe are abrogate, for wee have nothing to doe with <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Law leſſe ours becauſe wee are not <hi>Iewes:</hi> We looke not to <hi>Sinai</hi> the hill of Bondage, but to <hi>Sion</hi> the mountain of grace; and wee take the Law as an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall will, written in our hearts by the Spirit of God, from which we do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect life, not feare rigour.</p>
               <p n="3">

               <p n="5">5 In the ſpeciall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the ſubiect: 1 The Law, was to man innocent; the Goſpell, to man a ſinner. 2 The Law was to <hi>Adam,</hi> and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally to all his poſterity:

'Tis our caſe, wee are the men. In what a ſlaviſh thraldome were wee by nature, being chained, and ſervants to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers luſts and pleaſures? Chriſt was pleaſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us, and to pay his bloud, a ranſome: Oh let us live unto him that dyed

Why ſtand yee, all your youth, al your age, all your life time idle? Hath no man hired you? Was not the bloud of Chriſt laid down for you? Let us at length bee aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of our barrenneſſe and unfruitfulneſſe in good works.
